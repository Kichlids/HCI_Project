# HCI_Project
Human Computer Interaction 2019


Overall:  
  More styling needed.  
  
Note:  
 <t>Tested by Nexus 5X API 28 (virtual device in android studio)  
  All examples are hard coded.  
  If there are multiple example, only the first one will work.  
  
Things that need improvement:  
  LocalMap and NewTrip_Map could use a location search bar.  
  NewTrip_Map probably need back button and better instruction.  
  LocalMap also need a back button?  

Things that isn't in the project yet:  
  My Group and its functionality  
  My Friend and its functionality  
  Chat system  
    (Find a way to implement or atleast mimic these 3 things)    
  Event Finder (Find an API!!)(If we can't find one, then we probably will have to omit this Event Finder feature)
